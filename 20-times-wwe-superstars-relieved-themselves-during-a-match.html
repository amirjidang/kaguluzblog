Whether it’s lack of stomach muscles or just the way the hit is taken, it can have disastrous consequences. Not to mention that urine or poop has worked its way into far too many storylines in the WWE's history.</p><p>Wrestlers are not given a lot of time off and if they are a part of a main event storyline and fall ill with something like food poisoning, then it may not be the easiest for the WWE to replace them on&nbsp;short notice.</p><p>This means many superstars are forced to wrestle injured or ill and as you're about to find out, this can have embarrassing consequences. Sometimes it’s not even injury or illness that is the problem, some people suffer from stage fright and this is their body's reaction to a live audience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whatever the reason, there have been many superstars who have managed to soil themselves inside a WWE ring. Luckily the audience has often only found out about this after the event, when either the wrestler in question or his opponent revealed the truth. So at least one thing is clear, their ability to act like nothing is wrong can also translate to their ability to hide some poop.</p><p>The following is a list of the 20 times WWE superstars have managed to allow their bowels to do the talking, it is never pretty but if you have to go, then you have to go.</p><h2 id=20-seth-rollins><strong>20. Seth Rollins</strong></h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The former member of The Shield made dirt sheet headlines back in 2014 when he admitted that he needed the toilet during a match.</p><p>Obviously it was much easier for him to leave a match during the time he was tagging with <a href=#>Dean Ambrose</a> and <a href=#>Roman Reigns</a>. After all, why not just tag out of the match and roll underneath to do his business?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He admitted that this is exactly what he did, but being the classy guy that he is, he found a bottle and urinated in that instead of on the floor. I suppose it's not poop, but admitting to having to roll under the ring to do your business is definitely not the best mental image.</p><p></p><h2 id=19-mr-perfect><strong>19. Mr. Perfect</strong></h2><p>One story that is highly speculated online is the fact that Mr. Perfect was waiting under the ring to do a run in and he needed a bathroom break. Obviously there is no way that wrestlers can leave once they are positioned under the ring so he had to do it where he was.</p><p>This is what happens when you make him and Scott Norton wait almost the entire show for the run in. I guess the bookers didn't think about how to use the washroom, so Hennig was forced to use wrestlers refer to as “The Emergency Bucket” and then had to lie beside it for the rest of the night until their opportunity to enter the ring.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=18-doink-the-clown><strong>18. Doink The Clown</strong></h2><p>Doink was a funny guy, but hopefully he was able to have a sense of humor after one particular stinky incident.&nbsp;Sometimes there is no medication in the world that will stop it coming out when it’s coming out, and that is what happened to Doink.</p><p>Apparently the colourful superstar seemed to be having a lot of bathroom breaks before the show until he was scheduled to wrestle, and just because he was in the ring, did not mean that desire stopped. To his credit, he did appear to wrestle, but was done within a few minutes because he told the ref to make the three count and ended the match after under two minutes, all because he really needed to go to the bathroom.</p><p>He then ran out of the ring and to the toilet. At least he was more fortunate than most people on this list and were able to spare the audience from an unforgettable sight.</p><p></p><h2 id=17-doug-basham><strong>17. Doug Basham</strong></h2><p>Many wrestlers think that they are going to fall foul to the mistake of saying too much in interviews, but sometimes they say just enough when they are asked the right questions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Doug was part of a feature in WWE’s Magazine and he was asked about his most embarrassing moment as a wrestler. He then went on to confess that he had soiled himself in the ring during a tag match with his brother Danny.</p><p>The match was thought to have taken place at WWE’s WrestleMania 20 pay-per-view, perhaps it can be chalked up to a bad case of stage fright?</p><p></p><h2 id=16-shawn-michaels><strong>16. Shawn Michaels</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Shawn Michaels </a>is one of the only people on this list that was forced to urinate in the ring. While some wrestlers did not mean to use the washroom, this time it was a planned storyline between Michaels and <a href=#>Vince McMahon</a>.</p><p>Michaels and McMahon had a back and forth rivalry heading into WrestleMania 22 back in 2006 and as part of this McMahon forced HBK to take a drugs test in the middle of the ring.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Michaels obviously couldn’t refuse his boss and went right ahead, urinating in the ring live on an episode of Monday night Raw. Much to the delight of the crowd, HBK then threw the urine all over McMahon. Something tells me that probably pissed him off.</p><p></p><h2 id=15-dusty-rhodes><strong>15. Dusty Rhodes</strong></h2><p>John Nord was a special guest of a shoot interview with Bill Alfonso. On the show, Nord discussed how larger wrestlers used to wrap toilet paper around their hands and insert it into their behind as a way to help them if they were about to have an accident. To make it even classier, they called these a “muffler.”</p><p>He then wrestled <a href=#>Dusty Rhodes</a> later that night and he went for a piledriver finish and as he picked Dusty up by one of his cheeks, his “muffler” managed to fall out in the middle of the ring.</p><p>He went ahead with the finish but many fans at ringside saw the object fall out and began to heckle Dusty for wearing it.</p><p></p><h2 id=14-darren-young><strong>14. Darren Young</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Darren Young</a> was asked his most embarrassing moment as part of WWE Inbox on YouTube and he confessed that he had once soiled himself during a match.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He said that Titus O’Neil had managed to get him hooked on vitamins that basically “clean you out.” He was supposed to take two but he took four instead, and before his match he felt quite strange.</p><p>Then during the match he was slammed and it all came out, all while he was wearing lime green tights!&nbsp;Talk about making a bad situation even worse!</p><p></p><h2 id=13-stephanie-mcmahon><strong>13. Stephanie McMahon</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Stephanie McMahon</a> is the daughter of WWE Chairman Vince McMahon and also a principle owner of WWE herself. She always portrays herself as a woman of dignity, grace and power, that was until Payback 2014.</p><p>Stephanie was a part of the main event story line where she was trying to force <a href=#>Daniel Bryan</a> to drop the WWE World Heavyweight Championship by firing his wife if he didn’t comply.</p><p>Brie ruined this when she quit the company instead and slapped Stephanie across the face, Steph then ran to the back like a scolded dog with a suspicious stain on her dress. Leading people to speculate that perhaps the billion dollar princess had an accident?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=12-natalya><strong>12. Natalya</strong></h2><p>Natalya is the only female wrestler ever to graduate from the Hart dungeon and she is currently one of the best female technical wrestlers in WWE.</p><p>She is also one of the main characters on Total Divas and it was being a part of this show that ultimately revealed one of her secrets.</p><p>Natalya had a match with Naomi and was kicked in the stomach; you can imagine what happened. Natalya then accused Naomi of hitting her to hard and forcing her to wet herself. This match was&nbsp;shown on Total Divas, leading to many of&nbsp;Natalya’s colleagues&nbsp;to mock her.</p><p></p><h2 id=11-triple-h><strong>11. Triple H</strong></h2><p>The King of Kings himself proved that no one is too powerful for a minor accident when he came out to attack <a href=#>Brock Lesnar</a> back in 2012.</p><p><a href=#>Triple H</a> and Brock had a fantastic rivalry that engulfed most of that year, but in this particular brawl, Triple H was seen with a rather big stain on the crotch of his trousers. This was made all the more evident when he was being F5’d through the announce table by Brock.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>WWE later released a video of Triple H where he told Billy Gunn that he would never consume that much liquid before a match again because it could lead to an accident.</p><p></p><h2 id=10-vince-mcmahon><strong>10. Vince McMahon</strong></h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Vince McMahon was a part of many main event rivalries and still continues to be to this day, but there will never be a fiercer rival that <a href=#>Stone Cold Steve Austin</a>.</p><p>The former WWE Champion forced the Chairman of WWE to actually wet himself in the middle of the WWE ring on a live episode of Raw.</p><p>Austin was threatening McMahon with a gun, that he thought was actually real, but when he did finally pull the trigger, he showed that it was a fake. Austin then laughed at having scared his boss so much that he had actually urinated himself.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-yokozuna><strong>9. Yokozuna</strong></h2><p>There are many stories online about Yokozuna and the fact that he always needed to be in close proximity to a toilet and if he wasn’t then there were dire consequences.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This particular story was told by <a href=#>Bret Hart</a> when he recalled that he faced Yokozuna in India on a particular bad day for the Samoan, who was suffering from a rather bad stomach issue.</p><p>Hart was bout to take Yokozuna’s finisher as part of the match and he looked up to see that he had actually soiled himself and was about to land on him,&nbsp;putting a whole new meaning on the phrase finisher. Hart states that it is the fastest he has ever moved in a wrestling ring.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-tommy-dreamer><strong>8. Tommy Dreamer</strong></h2><p>Tommy Dreamer is remembered as one of the most extreme wrestling legends of all time, but even he managed to fall foul to nature.</p><p>As part of an interview with Jeff Pearlman, Tommy recalled that he was in a match with <a href=#>Mark Henry</a> and he had just received his finisher (The World’s Strongest Slam) when he smelled something terrible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He thought the strain of the move had forced Henry to “let one go,” but he later discovered that the force of the move had actually caused him to defecate himself. He couldn’t believe it because he didn’t even feel it happen.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-vince-mcmahon><strong>7. Vince McMahon</strong></h2><p>The second entry from the WWE Chairman on the list as he becomes the only person to have both urinated and defecated in a WWE Ring.</p><p><a href=#>Jim Ross</a> told the story in a recent interview and it seems Vince McMahon is still annoyed about the fact that it became public knowledge. Ross stated that once during a backstage promo Vince had accidentally “sharted” and left a stain on his trousers but he still headed out to the ring afterwards because he had no time to change.</p><p>Vince was also said to have then actually chased Gerald Brisco around in the ring with the stain still evident.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-andre-the-giant><strong>6. Andre The Giant</strong></h2><p>One of the more disgusting additions to the list, but it sees <a href=#>Andre The Giant</a> join after it was revealed that he managed to not only soil himself, but someone else as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bad News Brown confirmed in an interview that Andre had been feeling really ill the day they had a match, but the show had to go on and Andre still managed to wrestle that night.</p><p>Things went from bad to worse during a&nbsp;big splash spot in the corner that led to Andre losing all&nbsp;control of his body, with the defecation getting on both Andre and the BNB. Perhaps not shockingly, BNB then ran and tried to shower off. Some things you can never truly wash away though.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-stone-cold-steve-austin><strong>5. Stone Cold Steve Austin</strong></h2><p>After forcing Vince McMahon to relieve himself&nbsp;in the ring, it seems only fair that Stone Cold Steve Austin joins the list after Yokozuna managed to force it all out of him during a match in South Africa.</p><p>Austin told the story when he was a part of WWE Tough Enough, he stated that he was picked up for a big slam by the big Samoan and admitted that it all just came out of him when the slam connected with the ground. He went on to state that he was relieved that he had worn black trousers during this particular match.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-sycho-sid><strong>4. Sycho Sid</strong></h2><p>Sycho Sid was definitely considered one of the biggest characters&nbsp;in wrestling history. If there was any doubt, it was confirmed when during his final match with&nbsp;<a href=#>The Undertaker</a> at WrestleMania 13, he left The Deadman a lasting gift.</p><p>The rumour was that Undertaker lifted Sid up for his tombstone finisher and smelled what he had done. Sid then rushed from the ring to sort himself out after his accident, that many thought he had done on purpose.</p><p>Undertaker later confirmed that this exact incident has happened with him and Sid, but it is thought to have happened at a house show a little earlier than the WrestleMania event.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-cm-punk><strong>3. CM Punk</strong></h2><p><a href=#>CM Punk</a>&nbsp;may have claimed he was the best in the world, but his time in the WWE was not all highlights. Punk was part of one of the most controversial wrestling podcasts in November 2014 when he sat down with Cult Cabana and talked all about WWE.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Punk revealed that he had been given so many antibiotics for what he was told was an infection in his back that at one point he had gone out to the ring for a match and legitimately couldn’t control his bowels.</p><p>Punk wasn’t embarrassed by the statement and used it as a way to show how his previous employers had neglected his well being while he was in their care.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-yokozuna><strong>2. Yokozuna</strong></h2><p>As already stated above, there are many stories involving Yokozuna and the fact that he had major bowel&nbsp;problems, one of which actually sees him falling through a toilet whilst backstage at a WWE event. Bret Hart and The Undertaker were backstage when they heard Yokozuna crying out for help after the toilet that he was on exploded under his weight. This may not have happened in a ring, but it is by far one of the funniest mental images out there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another story involving Yokunza talks about an alleged tag-team match in which he was unable to leave, so he soiled himself on the ring apron before he took the tag and entered the ring. Talk about one way to make sure your opponent doesn't get too close.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-john-cena><strong>1. John Cena</strong></h2><p><a href=#>John</a>’s story has become one of the most famous in the wrestling industry and this is perhaps because he wasn’t even worried about admitting it.</p><p>Following Natalya’s accidental leakage on Total Divas, Nikki Bella went to find John to laugh about it only for him to tell her it wasn’t funny and confess that he had once had to take part in a match when he had food poisoning and managed to relieve himself from every opening.</p><p>John was thought to have had to roll under the ring to vomit as well as accidentally reliving himself while in the ring as well.</p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>invisionfree.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>youtube.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>wrestlezone.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>ewrestlingnews.com</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0e5FpZK2hnZrAbsPWnmSsraCav7TAwKuqZqqVobamwsSdZK2glaLAprjVnqpmnKWntq%2BzjJpkppmkmLVw</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2f20-times-wwe-superstars-relieved-themselves-during-a-match.html&title=20%20Times%20WWE%20Superstars%20Relieved%20Themselves%20During%20A%20Match" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f20-times-wwe-superstars-relieved-themselves-during-a-match.html&description=20%20Times%20WWE%20Superstars%20Relieved%20Themselves%20During%20A%20Match" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f20-times-wwe-superstars-relieved-themselves-during-a-match.html&title=20%20Times%20WWE%20Superstars%20Relieved%20Themselves%20During%20A%20Match" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2f20-times-wwe-superstars-relieved-themselves-during-a-match.html&title=20%20Times%20WWE%20Superstars%20Relieved%20Themselves%20During%20A%20Match" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2f20-times-wwe-superstars-relieved-themselves-during-a-match.html&text=20%20Times%20WWE%20Superstars%20Relieved%20Themselves%20During%20A%20Match" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2f20-times-wwe-superstars-relieved-themselves-during-a-match.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Kelle Repass</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-08-09</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./7-most-expensive-watches-in-jay-zs-collection.html><h3>&lt;&lt; 7 Most Expensive Watches In Jay-Z's Collection</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./20-images-that-prove-camila-cabello-is-clearly-the-next-jlo.html><h3>20 Images That Prove Camila Cabello Is Clearly The Next JLo >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
