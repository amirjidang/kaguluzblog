But in recent years, it was dating the pop star that placed Joe more and more in the spotlight, even as the pair tried their hardest to remain elusive.</p><p>Joe's first film was directed by three-time Academy Award-winning director, Ang Lee.

Alwyn was not heard from until September 2023, <a href=#>nearly six months after the two broke up</a> when he posted an update of his travels. Not only was this a return to the public eye but to social media. The last time Alwyn had posted anything was in May 2022. But that did not last long as Alwyn has posted nothing since and has remained quiet on who he is dating and his professional life as well. Something that is looking to change in 2024 and beyond with several projects in various stages of production, meaning that Alwyn will likely be hitting the red carpet in the future.</p><h2 id=zorro-was-joe-alwyn-39-s-childhood-hero><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>Zorro Was Joe Alwyn's Childhood Hero</span></h2><h3 id=joe-alwyn-met-antonio-banderas-in-2019>Joe Alwyn met Antonio Banderas in 2019</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/instar51601232-1.jpg><ul><li><strong>Joe had to hold himself back from challenging Antonio to a duel</strong></li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Joe can go ahead and check “meeting your childhood hero” off of his list.
